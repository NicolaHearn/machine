Like the second and third picture
Also you might want to add in comments in our css code and group things styles together so that later when you come back to the project, you can easily remeber which styling was meant for which element
So say if you had a number of styles your footer, you might add a comment like 
//Footer realted styles
and then have all the footer styling under that
in your footer*

Also, keep id selected stylings to a minimum
Stick mostly with class based and element based styling
Have a read on CSS styling specificity to understand more about what i just mentioned
Also when naming your classes, instead of naming them like so: .accessoriesimages
use the camel casing as that is easier to read and is a widely used programming convention. Like this:
.accessoriesImages
